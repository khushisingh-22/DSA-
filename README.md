A professional repository dedicated to mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** using Java. This project serves as a comprehensive log of my daily problem-solving journey, focusing on writing clean, efficient, and optimized code.

 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this repository is to build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking. Each module contains implementations of core data structures, solved problems, and detailed analysis of time and space complexities.

 📂 Roadmap & Progress

| Topic | Description | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Arrays](./arrays/)** | Traversal, Sliding Window, Two-Pointer, and Subarray logic. | 🟢 Active |
| **Strings** | Pattern matching, Palindromes, and String manipulation. | 🟡 Upcoming |
| **Recursion** | Backtracking, Subset problems, and Divide & Conquer. | 🔴 Planned |
| **Sorting & Searching** | Binary Search, QuickSort, MergeSort, etc. | 🔴 Planned |


 🛠️ Key Features

* Clean Code: Follows standard Java naming conventions and best practices.
* Topic-wise Organization: Each data structure has its own dedicated directory.
* Complexity Analysis: Every solution includes Big O notation analysis.
* Input Handling: Robust logic using `Scanner` for dynamic user inputs.

# 🚀 Getting Started

1.  *Clone the Repository:*
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/khushisingh-22/Daily-DSA-Java.git](https://github.com/khushisingh-22/Daily-DSA-Java.git)
    ```
2.  *Navigate and Run:*
    ```bash
    cd arrays
    javac outputinputarray.java
    java outputinputarray
    ```

## 📈 Learning Goals

- [ ] Complete 200+ DSA problems.
- [ ] Understand trade-offs between different data structures.
- [ ] Master optimization techniques like Dynamic Programming.
